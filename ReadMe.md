Med Coind Api

Med Coin is a start up that allows people to access medical documents by scanning qr codes. This is the code for the backend.

Created a Restful api and the c library zbars allowing users to scan a qr code and recive the information on the app. In terms of security it really sucks and would never be used in the real world but this was just a prototype.
